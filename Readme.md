- Average numerics by contract and internet 
    - People leaving the company have paid more money in general when they have a 2-year contract.
    - People who have a month-to-month contract are most likely to churn.
    - People who have used phone services and multiple lines tend to pay more in general, but we saw that these customers tend to leave the company if they have to pay higher monthly charges.

- Streaming services analysis by churn and contract
    - Customers subscribed to streaming movies and streaming TV were contributing more to revenue (high LTVs).
    - Many customers subscribed to these services left the company as they had to pay higher monthly charges. So, customers are more likely to leave the company if we try to increase the LTV by increasing the monthly charges. Hence, the company can decide to check the effect that increasing LTV has on churn and then take a decision.

- Contract pattern by charges and tenure
    - Having a 2-year contract is the best for having a high LTV and also for retaining the customers for as long as possible.
    - Customers with a month-to-month contract do not contribute much to LTV and are also more likely to churn.

- Payment method pattern by charges and tenure
    - We should encourage customers to make more automatic payments because such people generally have higher LTVs and stay with us longer.
- LTV by the most important services and by contract
    - We want to encourage customers to use 2-year contracts, internet services, phone services and multiple lines.
